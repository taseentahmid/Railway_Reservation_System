# Railway_Reservation_System

This project implements a simple railway reservation system using C++. It allows users to add trains, book tickets, and display passenger lists for each train.

# Features:

The Railway Reservation System includes the following features:

Add a train: 

Users can add a new train to the system by providing details such as the train name, source station, destination station, and capacity.

Book a ticket: 

Users can book a ticket for a specific train. If there are available seats, they will be prompted to enter passenger details such as name, gender, and age. The passenger information is then saved, and the available seat count is updated.

Display passenger list:

 Users can view the list of passengers for a particular train. The system retrieves the passenger information from the corresponding data file and displays it on the console.

# Usage:

To use the Railway Reservation System, follow these steps:

Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.

Run the compiled program.

Choose one of the following options from the menu:

Add a train:

 Enter the train details, such as the train name, source station, destination station, and capacity.

Book a ticket:

 Enter the name of the train for which you want to book a ticket. If seats are available, provide the passenger details.
Display passenger list: Enter the name of the train for which you want to display the passenger list. The system will show the details of all the passengers on that train.
Continue using the system by selecting options from the menu until you choose to exit.

# File Structure:

The project follows a file-based approach to store train and passenger data. Each train is associated with a data file that contains the train's information and the passenger details.
